## [1.3.0] - 2026-10-30

Lessons from the "smart greenhouse" project on a TPP3 (three iterations, each compiled by Tibbo's TIDE compiler and
uploaded to AppBlocks): what breaks the generated code at compile time, how relays and Modbus behave in the generated
firmware, and how to run MQTT with your own broker.

### Both skills
- **Reliability first.** Tibbits and parts are chosen for reliability and efficiency, not for the lowest price: relays
  with margin for motor loads, isolated inputs where ground loops are possible, an adapter sized for inrush current.
- **Compile, don't just generate.** A project is ready only after the generated code compiles; a successful
  `ab_api.py code` is not enough.

### appblocks
- **New `references/mqtt.md`.** The `mqtt` feature and its blocks; the broker IP as a device setting (`linked_setting`),
  so a new laptop IP needs no reflash; `TOPICS` are subscriptions only; `{{$data}}` is seen only by the next block;
  library behaviour: publishing while offline is dropped silently (no buffer), auto-reconnect every 10 s,
  `MQTT_LARGE_PACKETS`; control logic stays on the controller. Your own Mosquitto broker: configs for a lab and for
  production, `mosquitto_sub`/`mosquitto_pub` checks, and the usual reasons a device does not connect (firewall,
  Mosquitto 2.x listening only on localhost, Wi-Fi client isolation, changed IP, duplicate client id).
- **`ab_api.py build <project.json> [--release] [--out prefix]`** - generates the code and compiles it with Tibbo's
  TIDE compiler (`POST /api/projects/build`, no key needed), prints errors and warnings, saves the `.tpc`, exits 1 on
  failure.
- **`ab_tool.py check` catches compile errors before the build:** a `{{$…}}` reference to a setting instead of its
  autovariable, variable names that clash with Modbus device names (case-insensitive, "Name conflict" in the editor),
  #05 RS485 without a port variable, 1-Wire sensors without the `tbl` service and OWSENS table. Warnings: a relay
  variable whose DEFAULT is not 1 (relays are active LOW, so the default sets the boot state), writing to a read-only
  Modbus register.
- **Example `greenhouse_tpp3.json`** - TPP3 with Modbus RTU sensors, #06 relays for pumps and fan, #17 PWM lamps, #54
  water level float, #61 isolated ADC for a Hall current sensor, MQTT telemetry and commands. **`mqtt_logger.py`** - a
  receiver for the PC: MQTT → SQLite → charts, commands to the device (paho-mqtt 1.x and 2.x).
- `generated-code.md`: compile findings and how the generated code drives relays, PWM, the ADC, Modbus polling (a
  timed-out register keeps its old value), MQTT and the timer. `format.md`, `api.md` (build endpoint, read-only key
  gives 403, reload the editor after `update`), `editor.md` (Name conflict).

### tibbo-firmware
- `SKILL.md`: the reliability principle; compile through the AppBlocks build API; relay polarity in the checklist.
- `tibbit-selection.md`: relay ratings (#03 1 A/30 V, #06 16 A/48 V, #07 1 A; all active LOW), #17 PWM, #54 for float
  switches (fail-safe wiring), #61 isolation and Hall sensor wiring (the isolated ground must not be tied to board GND).
- `power.md` §6а: sizing the 230/12 V adapter (pumps' inrush, fan, lamps, controller; ≥ 8 A at 12 V in the example).
- `tps_check.py`: connector pairing is checked in both directions - no more false "#62 + #21" warning. Regression
  configs `tests/greenhouse_tpp3.json`, `tests/onewire_62_21.json`.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-10-26

Lessons from building ten turnkey recipes (github.com/SCANCODE-IOT/tibbo-recipes): the AppBlocks editor's hardware-canvas
rules, connector pinouts, and two firmware mistakes that only show on 16-bit platforms or with fast system timers.

### Both skills
- **AppBlocks canvas warnings.** The editor draws yellow triangles on Tibbit sockets ("Incorrect pair", "Connector
  required", "Tibbit required", missing-line messages). They are not listed in Problems and do not stop the build, so a
  project with "0 errors, 0 warnings" can still be flagged. The rule (`getTppProjectWarnings`) and the editor's own
  connector table were taken from app.appblocks.io into `data/appblocks_pairs.json`; `scripts/ab_pairs.py` repeats the
  check and matches the editor on 60 random TPP2/TPP3 layouts.
- **Docs vs editor.** The editor accepts only #18 next to power Tibbits #09, #10, #25, #33 (docs.tibbo.com also lists
  #19/#20/#21), has no allowed connectors for #12 and #23, and needs #00-3 next to C sensors #28-#41.

### tibbo-firmware
- `tps_check.py check` warns "AppBlocks отметит …" for such layouts, says when the documentation allows the pair, and
  recommends the editor-approved pair for public solutions (the documentation-only variant stays a niche option at the
  user's risk). The "#20 instead of two #21" hints are no longer given when the editor would reject #20. New
  `ab_pairs.py` command line. Regression configs `tests/ab_*.json`.
- `tibbit-selection.md` §4: M1/C1/C2 pinouts, terminal maps of #18, #20, #21, #54 inputs (on TPP2(G2) S10+S12: #20
  terminals 1-4 → module in S9, 5 → ground, 6-9 → module in S11); §5: the editor rules and the docs/editor differences.
  `power.md`: power input connectors per editor, #09/#18 input and ground pins.
- Checklist: UART divider `ser.div9600 * 9600 / baud` overflows a word on 16-bit platforms (wrong baud rate on DS110x) -
  divide first; `dhcp/dns/mqtt/sntp_proc_timer` must keep the 0.5 s period when `sys.onsystimerperiod` is faster.
- `libraries.md`: using latest tibbotech Tibbit drivers with TIDE libraries 2_01_05 (`super_i2c.tbh` before `ssi.tbh`,
  `fstr()` missing for `cellular`).

### appblocks
- `ab_tool.py check`: hardware-canvas warnings ("плата: …") and a check that `{{$param}}` can reach the block
  (parameters are seen only by the next block; ports whose parameters the registry does not list are skipped - no false
  positives on the bundled examples).
- `editor.md` §9 rewritten from the editor code; §9а: the **Wiring** view (Tibbit schematics with pin and terminal
  numbers). `format.md`: settings are referenced by their autovariable ID; #54 has no interrupt mode (Button Input gives
  `<line>_kp` for On Button Pressed); canvas warnings.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-10-22

### Fixed
- Removed `certifi-*.whl` that was committed by mistake into `skills/appblocks/scripts/` in 1.1.1 and got into `appblocks.zip`
  (the file was not used by the skill). `tools/package.sh` now refuses to package anything but text sources, and `*.whl` is in `.gitignore`.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-10-22

Hotfix after user reports: scripts on Windows, and AppBlocks code generation facts checked against `POST /api/projects/code`.

### Fixed
- **Windows console encoding.** Every script (`ab_tool.py`, `ab_api.py`, `build_registry.py`, `tps_check.py`, `state_diagram.py`,
  `build_data.py`) now prints UTF-8 regardless of the console code page, so cp1251/cp1252 consoles no longer stop them with
  `UnicodeEncodeError` (for example `ab_tool.py lookup node_math_compound`). All files are opened with an explicit `encoding="utf-8"`.
- **`CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` in `ab_api.py`.** HTTPS uses `SSL_CERT_FILE` / `SSL_CERT_DIR` if set, otherwise `truststore`
  (the OS store) or `certifi` when installed, otherwise Python's default. Verification is never disabled. A failed check now
  prints what to do on Windows instead of the sandbox hint; new `ab_api.py tls` shows the store in use and tests the connection.

### Added
- `ab_tool.py check`: error when Digital Line Set `LINE_NUMBER` is not a number (`PL_IO_NUM_48` is written into the code as a string);
  warning when the line is not made an output by the framework; error for comparison operators other than `=` `<>` `<` `<=` `>` `>=`
  on `tios` (`==` and `!=` go into Tibbo BASIC as is).
- `generated-code.md`: Digital Line Set, IF Condition, Custom Function, On Time Period (fires every N+1 ticks: 0.5 s is 0.51 s),
  `LEDPAT` (adds a red error pattern on Settings library init failures, no effect without Settings), the TPP signal strength bar
  driver (`signal_strength_set`). Each fact is marked: checked by generation, not checked in the editor, TIDE or on hardware.
- `editor.md` §8: driving the TPP signal strength bar from logic; `SKILL.md`: `tbt22` as a minimal base for a new tios project.
- tibbo-firmware `tios-api.md`: `pat.playlb` exists only on LTPP3(G2); on TiOS boards the bar is driven by the application.
- `ab_tool.one_id()`; `new_id()` docstring says it always returns a list.
- README and both `SKILL.md`: running the scripts on Windows.
- Tests run without `PYTHONUTF8` on a cp1251 console; CI on `windows-latest` (Python 3.12, 3.14) and an HTTPS check from Windows
  with `truststore` and `certifi`.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-22

Skills retrained on the AppBlocks editor itself (app.appblocks.io) and on the full docs.tibbo.com sources (2,325 pages, received from Tibbo on 2026-10-21).

### appblocks
- **Added** `references/blocks.md`: all 168 editor blocks (was 59 seen in examples) by palette category - ports with parameters, settings with allowed values and defaults, required feature, ASYNC; 45 hidden/legacy blocks listed separately.
- **Added** `references/features.md`: 30 features, 32 service libraries, 41 nested item types, 66 `tibbit_NN` field sets, 29 peripherals, 30 LCD / web console widgets.
- **Added** `data/registry.json` with `scripts/build_registry.py` and `scripts/extract_registry.js` (read-only browser extractor) to refresh it when AppBlocks changes.
- **Added** `ab_tool.py lookup <block|feature|word>`.
- **Changed** `ab_tool.py check` now also reports: unknown block type, link to a port the block does not have, setting value outside the allowed list, block whose feature is missing (or disabled), blocks no longer in the palette, blocks/features unavailable on the project's board. No false positives on the 78 appblocks.io projects and 5 real user projects.
- **Added** plugin format (`custom_feature`: settings, code blocks with `{{feature.settings.*}}` / `{{block.output}}`, variables) to `format.md` §5, based on the three marketplace plugins.
- **Added** to `editor.md`: how the editor validates Tibbit placement (§9), the editor's built-in AI assistant and text project view (§10), the plugin marketplace.
- **Changed** `SKILL.md`: new references, review rule for legacy blocks, how to refresh the registry.

### tibbo-firmware
- **Added** `references/docs-map.md`: topic → docs.tibbo.com page and its Russian translation on tibbo.ru/kb (objects, syscalls, libraries, platforms, TPS, all Tibbits, Monitor/Loader, Linux).
- **Changed** Tibbit catalog checked against 76 `tibbit_NN` pages: 84 Tibbits (added #47, #51, #56, all deprecated); #02 and #44 need an interrupt line for RTS/CTS; mating connectors for #09/#10/#16/#17/#23/#25/#33 per docs.
- **Fixed** #13/#14 own +5V consumption is 10/20 mA; the former 66/56 mA already included the #12 share, so the power budget counted it twice.
- **Changed** `tios-api.md`: defaults and notes from docs (watchdog, `sys.timercountms`, `net.gatewayip`, `stor.base`/`stor.size`, `wln.dhcp`/`autoconnect`, `kp.repeatdelay`, `ssi.baudrate` is writable, deprecated PPPoE and WS1102 properties).
- **Added** `platforms.md`: platform parameters table (16/32-bit, clock, RAM, EEPROM, UART FIFO, debugging, dual apps), docs vs .tph constant names, LTPP3(G2) line map.
- **Added** `project-and-libs.md` §9: facts for code and review - 16-bit arithmetic, `doevents` rules, VM exceptions in release builds, EEPROM/flash wear, Monitor/Loader and MD button, WM2000/WS1102 DCB and dual apps, DS110x port modes, LTPP3(G2).
- **Changed** `power.md`, `libraries.md`, `SKILL.md` (16-bit arithmetic, release exceptions, EEPROM service area is usually 28 bytes, not 8).
- **Added** `tps_check.py` rules from the AppBlocks editor: WA2000U needs RF connector #37; hints to use one #20 instead of #21 for double-width modules or two #21 in one tile.
