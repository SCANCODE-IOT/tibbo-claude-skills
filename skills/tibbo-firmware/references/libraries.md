# Tibbo BASIC libraries (auto-extracted from github.com/tibbotech/libraries)

How libraries work: add the library's .tbh/.tbs files to the project (TIDE: Add existing file / libraries come with
TIDE in Platforms/src/<ver>/), `include` its .tbh from global.tbh, set configuration `#define`s in global.tbh
BEFORE the include (each lib uses `#ifndef X / #define X default`), call `<lib>_start()` style init from
on_sys_init, and IMPLEMENT every `callback_*` sub/function the library declares (empty body is OK when unused) —
otherwise the project fails to link. Many libs require the timer/event hooks listed in their .tbs (e.g. calls
from on_sys_timer, on_sock_data_arrival, on_sock_event, on_wln_event) — check the lib .tbs header comments.
